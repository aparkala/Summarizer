Abandonment rate is one of the most broadly used on-line user satisfaction metrics to evaluate the quality of information retrieval (IR) systems and compare IR systems in A/B-testing experiments. It is generally considered that the lower abandonment rate is the better IR system performs. In reference, it was first introduced and analyzed the notion of good abandonment, i.e. situation when the user abandoned search engine result page because her information need has been satisfied1. We use the notion of potential good abandonment from the same work: we call a query to be a potential good abandonment if it can theoretically be answered directly on the SERP (Search Engine Result Page). They propose an exhaustive analysis of potential good/bad abandonment share in mobile/PC search and in various countries. Another work contains analysis of different types of good abandonment and special SERP elements dedicated to answer user query. In turn we propose a way to automatically predict query type (potential good/bad) using machine learning.
